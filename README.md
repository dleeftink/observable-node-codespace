## Start making changes

Wait for the codespace to be built and the setup scripts to finish running (this may take some time). 
- After succesfully setting up the environment, codespaces should
automatically open `index.md` to the left and a preview pane to the right.
- Additionally, a popup might open asking you to trust the live server destination.

You can edit the `index.md` contents, after which the content changes are reflected (with a slight delay) in the preview pane.

If updates stop being reflected in the preview pane, refresh the page. If even after refreshing, updates aren't propagated, execute `CTRL + C` in the terminal window after which you can restart the dev server using `npm run obs`.
- If you accidentally close the preview pane, you can re-open this by navigating to the `Ports` tab on the bottom half of the screen and hovering the `Forwarded Address`. Click the `Preview in Editor` icon that shows on hover to re-open the preview inside your codespace.
