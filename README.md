## Start making changes

Wait for the codespace container to be built and the setup scripts to finish (this may take some time). 

After succesfully setting up the environment, codespaces should
automatically open `index.md` to the left and a preview pane to the right.

You can edit the `index.md` contents, after which the content changes are reflected (with a slight delay) in the preview pane.
